This game is a proof of concept for a 3D Point and Click, Turn Based Strategy Game. 

We start by landing on planet environment tile, with limited fuel, our first mission is to recharge are ship with locating a natural power on the planet in the form of Power Crystals. The Local residence of this area might not like this and attempt to stop this energy collection grab. We must explore the planet and find resources. The Planet is made of of procedural crafted squares with a variety of enemy encounters, puzzles, and task to perform. If you run out of power completely, or attack and loose an enemy fight, the game ends.
